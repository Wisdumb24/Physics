# Eccentricity
1. type 'root eccentricity.cc' to read the root file and produce plots (does not consider time)

Information of all partons, final charged hadrons and jets are stored in a tree in 'pp_parton_cascade_0.root' and 'pp_parton_cascade_0.root', including their energies, momenta, etc.

2. type 'root test.C' to read the root file and produce plots (particles at 1.95 fm/c)
